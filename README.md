# Task Manager Application

In this Python project, we implemented a command-line Task Manager application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The application allows users to perform various operations on their tasks, including adding new tasks, viewing the task list, marking tasks as complete or incomplete, deleting tasks, and saving the tasks to an Excel file.

The application leverages the power of Python and utilizes two key libraries: SQLite for database management and Pandas for displaying task data in a tabular format within the console.

The project is structured using OOP principles, encapsulating the functionality into a TaskManager class. This class initializes a SQLite database to persist task data, creates a table to store tasks, and provides methods for adding, viewing, marking, deleting, and saving tasks.

Looking forward, the future goal of this project is to enhance the user experience by transitioning from a command-line interface to a visually appealing and user-friendly graphical interface. This evolution could involve the integration of GUI libraries or front-end programming languages to create a more intuitive and robust system. This transition would empower users to interact with the Task Manager in a more visually engaging and efficient manner, potentially improving overall usability and accessibility.
